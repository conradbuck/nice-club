        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>The NiCE club has been looking for a sponsor to help fund our club trip to Diablo Canyon. The club plans to rent several cars and an AirBnB to provide accomodations for all of the people that attend the trip. PG&E wasn't able to offer funding for these types of expenses, but they said they would help us find resources to make the trip happen. Fortunately, the Three Valleys Community Fund was gracious enough to give a grant to our club to help run our organization and finance our trip to Diablo.</p>

        <h4>Summary of Event</h4>
        <p>The NiCE club delegation left Berkeley at 3pm on the day of the event. (Thank you <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellybowersceo3vcf/" _target="_blank">Dr. Bowers</a> for the transportation assitance!) We arrived at the event space located in an office park surrounded by a pond. The foyer of the event was very fancy and the hors d'oeuvres were equally posh. The members chatted with a few of the other grant recipients before the ceremony in the adjacent auditorium. During the event, the NiCE club members learned about all of the different organizations that the Fund decided to support and the work they were doing to grow the community. The NiCE club was invited onto the stage along with the representatives from a few other organizations that were a part of the same giving caategory and was presented with a check for $5000.</p>
